## Features

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture

Our application implements multi-tenancy using a **shared schema with tenant ID columns** approach:

- **Data Isolation**: Each tenant's data is securely separated through tenant ID foreign keys
- **API Security**: Middleware ensures users can only access their own tenant's data
- **Efficient Infrastructure**: Single database instance with logical separation of data
- **Scalable Design**: Built to support hundreds of independent organizations

Each database query automatically filters by tenant ID, making it impossible for data to leak between organizations.

### Security & Authentication

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Two clearly defined user roles:
  - **Admin**: Can manage organization settings, invite team members, and control subscription
  - **Member**: Can create and manage notes within permission boundaries
- **Middleware Protection**: API routes are protected by authentication and authorization middleware
- **Secure Password Handling**: Proper password hashing and security practices

### Test Accounts

Ready to try the application? Use these test accounts (all use password: `password`):

| Email           | Role   | Organization |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| admin@org1.test | Admin  | ORG1         |
| user@org1.test  | Member | ORG1         |
| admin@org2.test | Admin  | ORG2         |
| user@org2.test  | Member | ORG2         |

### Subscription Plans & Feature Gating

Our SaaS model offers tiered subscription plans with feature limitations:

- **Free Plan**:
  - Limited to 3 notes per organization
  - Perfect for small teams or testing
  - Core features available
- **Pro Plan**:
  - Unlimited notes
  - Enhanced feature set
  - Priority support
- **Seamless Upgrades**: Admins can upgrade with one click, instantly removing limitations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear UI indicators when limits are reached

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for database)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhatia4404/MultiTenantNotesApp.git
   cd MultiTenantNotesApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file : `.env.example`

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Database Setup

The application requires the following tables in Supabase:

- `tenants`: Organization data and subscription information
- `users`: User accounts with tenant associations
- `notes`: Notes with tenant and user relationships

A sample SQL schema is available in the `db` folder. You can run this schema in your Supabase SQL editor to set up the necessary tables.
